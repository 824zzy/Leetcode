"""L3: DP
dp[t] means the furthest distance that we can get with t times of refueling.

So for every station s[i],
if the current distance dp[t] >= s[i][0], we can refuel:
dp[t + 1] = max(dp[t + 1], dp[t] + s[i][1])

In the end, we'll return the first t with dp[t] >= target,
otherwise we'll return -1.
