# Note

## Problem Solving Step

1. Split the original question into sub-questions
2. Confirm status
3. Confirm boundary conditions
4. Find state-transition equation

## Category

1. One Dimension
2. Two Dimension
   1. Longest Common Subsequence: 583, 1143
   2. Two pass for 4 directions: 542
3. LCS(Longest Common Subsequence)
4. Maze: for this type of problems, it will always give you a matrix and you can only move right or down in the matrix
5. Time sequential: current state is only related to limited previous states
6. Time dependent: current state is related to all the previous states
