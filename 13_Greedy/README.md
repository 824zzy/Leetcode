# Greedy cheatsheet

A greedy algorithm is any algorithm that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage. In many problems, a greedy strategy does not usually produce an optimal solution, but nonetheless, a greedy heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a globally optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time.

## Assign Problem

- Sorting arrays or strings is a common operation to facilitate later size comparison
- **Two pass technique** are frequently used.

## Interval Problem

It is necessary to determine whether to sort by the beginning of the interval or by the end of the interval according to the actual situation.
