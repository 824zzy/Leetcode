# Hash Table

## Basic Operations

1. `Counter.most_common(num)`: return a list contains tuple.
2. `del Counter[key]`: delete an item. or `Counter[key]=0`.
3. `cntA+cntB`: add two counters together.
4. `cntA-cntB`: subtract (keeping only positive counts).
5. `cntA&cntB`: find intersection of two counters. min(cntA, cntB)
6. `cntA|cntB`: find union of two counters. max(cntA, cntB)
