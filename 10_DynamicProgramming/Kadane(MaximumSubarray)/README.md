# Kadane's Algorithm

A simple idea of Kadaneâ€™s algorithm is to **look for all positive contiguous segments of the array** and **keep track of the maximum sum contiguous subarray** among all positive segments.

For a variance of Kadane's algorithm, it is always necessary to consider to two variable to record subarray.

## Template

``` py
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        ans, cur = -inf, 0
        for x in A:
            cur = max(x, cur+x)
            ans = max(ans, cur)
        return ans
```
